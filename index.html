        <h1>Our Solar System</h1>
        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <img src="earth.jpg" alt="earth.jpg" />
        <p>
            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
            object known to harbor life. This is made possible by Earth being an
            ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid
            surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its
            global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2%
            of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of
            continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of
            Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation,
            while large ice sheets at Earth's polar deserts retain more water
            than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water
            combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates,
            which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and
            earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a
            magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar
            winds and cosmic radiation.

        <h2>Mars</h2>

        <p>
            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is also known as the "Red
            Planet", for its orange-red appearance. Mars is a desert-like rocky
            planet with a tenuous atmosphere that is primarily carbon dioxide
            (CO2). At the average surface level the atmospheric pressure is a
            few thousandths of Earth's, atmospheric temperature ranges from −153
            to 20 °C (−243 to 68 °F), and cosmic radiation is high. Mars retains
            some water, in the ground as well as thinly in the atmosphere,
            forming cirrus clouds, fog, frost, larger polar regions of
            permafrost and ice caps (with seasonal CO2 snow), but no bodies of
            liquid surface water. Its surface gravity is roughly a third of
            Earth's or double that of the Moon. Its diameter, 6,779 km (4,212
            mi), is about half the Earth's, or twice the Moon's, and its surface
            area is the size of all the dry land of Earth.
