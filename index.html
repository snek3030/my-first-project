                Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the
                Solar System. It is a rocky planet with a trace atmosphere and a
                surface gravity slightly higher than that of Mars. The surface
                of Mercury is similar to Earth's Moon, being cratered, with an
                expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults, and bright
                ray systems, formed by ejecta. Its largest crater, Caloris
                Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi), which is about
                one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi).
                Being the most inferior orbiting planet, it always appears close
                to the Sun in Earth's sky, either as a "morning star" or an
                "evening star". It is the planet with the highest delta-v
                required for travel from Earth, as well as to and from the other
                planets in the Solar System.

                Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
                object known to harbor life. This is made possible by Earth
                being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System
                sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is
                contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust.
                The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is
                located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's
                land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid
                and covered by vegetation, while large ice sheets at Earth's
                polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes,
                rivers, and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists
                of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce
                mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid
                outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting
                most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is also known as the
                "Red Planet", for its orange-red appearance. Mars is a
                desert-like rocky planet with a tenuous atmosphere that is
                primarily carbon dioxide (CO2). At the average surface level the
                atmospheric pressure is a few thousandths of Earth's,
                atmospheric temperature ranges from -153 to 20 °C (-243 to 68
                °F), and cosmic radiation is high. Mars retains some water, in
                the ground as well as thinly in the atmosphere, forming cirrus
                clouds, fog, frost, larger polar regions of permafrost and ice
                caps (with seasonal CO2 snow), but no bodies of liquid surface
                water. Its surface gravity is roughly a third of Earth's or
                double that of the Moon. Its diameter, 6,779 km (4,212 mi), is
                about half the Earth's, or twice the Moon's, and its surface
                area is the size of all the dry land of Earth.
